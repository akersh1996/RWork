# delete the lines below and add your own test

x<-(-10:10)  # Set x up as a vector on integers (-10, -9,..., 9, 10)
y<-x^2       # set y as a vector whose values are square of x values
plot(y,type="l") # This will print a plot of y

# Once you have sourced this file you can type x and y in the console window below
# This will show you the values of x and y that have been defined above
